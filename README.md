Coursera

This repository contains a R script, which shows the code a used to create the tidy data for the Human Activity 
Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set  proyect. In these script you will see that I used the dplyr library that we learned in 
this course for cleaning and transformation tbl. Also, you will find a CodeBook.md file that describes the variables and data set and 
 explains what transformations and work I did to obtain a tidy data.
